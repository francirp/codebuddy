I'm still receiving the below Rspec failure for the apply diff spec. The ApplyDiff class appears to be working how I want it to, so please update the spec to get it to pass.

Failures:

  1) ApplyDiff#call correctly applies diff to the file
     Failure/Error: expect(File.read(file_path)).to eq(expected_content)
     
       expected: "class ExampleClass\n  attr_reader :items\n  def initialize(items)\n    @items = items\n  end\n\n  def sum_items\n    sum = 0\n    @items.each { |item| sum += item }\n    sum\n  end\nend\n"
            got: "class ExampleClass\n  attr_reader :items\n  def initialize(items)\n    @items = items\n  end\n\n  de...= item }\n    sum\n  end\nend\n\n\n\n    sum = 0\n    @items.each { |item| sum += item }\n    sum\n"
